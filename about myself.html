<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> My name is Dmitry Repka and I am a 4th year student of BSU.
    I just recently started learning web programming because this is a promising direction.
    First of all, I went to these courses in order to gain knowledge and skills that will be useful to me in the future.
    Although now my level is low, but every day I try to learn something new.</p>
